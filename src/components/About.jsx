                Welcome! I'm Polina, an experienced psychologist, consultant, and coach with roots in Kyiv, currently located in West Yorkshire, UK.

                My journey into the realm of psychology began after a robust educational foundation in international relations and a successful career in journalism, primarily in Ukraine. However, life took an unexpected turn when I relocated to Moscow, Russia, a place known for its restrictions on media freedom.

                A series of life-changing events inspired me to embark on a profound exploration of the intricate facets of human existence. From 2013 to 2018, I embarked on a transformative journey, immersing myself in meditation, spirituality, and Eastern psychology in India. This remarkable odyssey provided me with profound insights into the harmonious interplay between modern psychology and timeless ancient wisdom.

                My transition into psychology as a profession began with intensive self-exploration and personal psychotherapy rooted in the principles of Transactional Analysis, spanning from 2016 to 2019. In 2020, I further expanded my expertise by completing a comprehensive program in "Psychological Counselling - Coaching" at the prestigious Moscow Institute of Psychoanalysis.

                Within the field of psychology, my interests are diverse: encompassing emotion management, nurturing mental well-being, facilitating the pursuit of happiness, uncovering authentic human needs, expertly resolving inner conflicts, effectively addressing gender-related challenges, and mastering the art of conflict resolution within interpersonal relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                As a dedicated practitioner, my mission is to guide individuals towards a deeper understanding of themselves, foster personal growth, and provide support in navigating life's intricate challenges. Together, we can embark on a journey of self-discovery, empowerment, and transformative change.
